# 1 Point perspective experiment

## Definition

One Point Perspective is a type of linear perspective that uses a single vanishing point to create the illusion of depth in a work of art.

There are several methods of linear perspective, but one-point is a single point perspective and is the simplests.

One point perspective assumes the flat, facing planes of objects have no depth but the sides and edges leading away from the viewer have depth.  The artist need only decide the vertical and horizontal measurements of each form and connect them to a single vanishing point.  This will create an illusion of depth on paper.
